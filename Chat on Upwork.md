Hi Jeremy - Thanks for the proposal. Any chance we could find time for a very quick chat? Look forward to speaking, Bryan

Jeremy Schwab12:53 PM

Hi Bryan - thanks for getting back to me.  
Would it be possible to proceed via text for now instead of a live chat? I'm currently dealing with a device issue and will be switching to a new setup shortly. If you could share the main purpose of the conversation and what you'd like to cover, I'm happy to respond in detail here and keep things moving efficiently.

Bryan Dumont12:57 PM

Certainly. I’d like to understand how you typically onboard with clients for a system like this.  
Can you walk me through your usual onboarding process—from first access to existing code, through initial build, validation, and handoff? I’m especially interested in how you manage scope, iteration, and analyst interaction early on.

Jeremy Schwab1:01 PM

Thanks for clarifying.  
I start by reviewing the existing codebase and any live examples to understand what's already stable versus experimental, then align on which pieces are considered "core" versus configurable. Early scope is kept tight by identifying one representative study that exercises typing, quotas, and MaxDiff, and using that as the reference build rather than abstract requirements.  
Initial work focuses on getting a thin but end-to-end version running in field: core XML/JS modules, a minimal configuration layer, and observable outputs. Iteration happens in short cycles against real test data so logic can be validated and adjusted before the system is generalized. Analyst interaction is hands-on early, but limited to configuration and QA review, not core logic changes.  
Once behavior is validated, I harden the templates, document assumptions and extension points, and shift from building to repeatability. Handoff is structured around "how to run the next study" rather than code walkthroughs, with analysts able to launch variations without touching underlying logic.

Bryan Dumont1:08 PM

Cool. Sorry about not answering the question you posed in the proposal: I'm less concerned about an analyst UX, and more focused on turning something so brittle into something we know can operate reliably and have enough flexibility for the inevitable customization that happens in every study. I've never used upwork before- what do next steps look like?

Jeremy Schwab1:13 PM

That makes sense - reliability and controlled flexibility are exactly where these systems usually break if they're not structured carefully.  
On Upwork, next steps are simple: once you're comfortable moving forward, you send an offer with the hourly rate and a rough cap or weekly limit. After it's accepted, you can grant access to the existing codebase or a staging link, and work can start immediately under Upwork's contract and time tracking.  
From my side, the first action would be a short technical pass on the current implementation to identify what should be stabilized versus parameterized, then proceed with tightening the core logic before expanding flexibility.

Bryan Dumont1:15 PM

What is your estimate for number of hours (range)?

Jeremy Schwab1:27 PM

Based on similar builds, I'd estimate roughly 90-130 hours end to end. The lower end assumes the existing Decipher foundation is solid and designs are clean; the upper end accounts for hardening the core logic and wiring the dashboard cleanly without surprises.

Bryan Dumont2:38 PM

ok. getting my finance person to set me up

Jeremy Schwab2:40 PM

Sounds good. I'll keep an eye out here - once everything's set up on your side, just send the offer and we can get started.

Bryan Dumont3:43 PM

sorry to bug you again - quick question... how is your old-school stats proficiency for things like recalibrating cluster solutions (k-means) and/or logit/multinomial models; and any experience running raw maxdiff complex utilities (running item variants across dicerete segments)?

to be clear - NOT requirements for this job

Jeremy Schwab3:47 PM

No problem at all.  
I'm comfortable with that layer. I've recalibrated k-means and hierarchical cluster solutions outside the survey environment to stabilize segments across waves, and I've built and interpreted binary, multinomial, and conditional logit models for classification and choice data. I've also worked directly with raw MaxDiff choice matrices, estimating utilities, normalizing them across segments, and running item variants through discrete segment cuts rather than relying only on packaged outputs.

Bryan Dumont3:48 PM

where have you been my whole life?!

Jeremy Schwab3:50 PM

Ha - apparently buried in XML and utility matrices. Glad the timing finally lined up.

Bryan Dumont3:53 PM

It'll be tomorrow morning when I get sign off. Looking forward to working together

Jeremy Schwab3:56 PM

Sounds good - looking forward to it.

I need to move this project over to my company’s (Reservoir Communications) newly created main Upwork account for billing and compliance reasons. To move forward, we’ll be reposting the role there and would appreciate it if you could submit the same proposal to the new posting. Nothing about the scope or interest has changed - just an administrative step. I’ll send you the link as soon as it’s live. Thanks

Jeremy Schwab8:04 AM

All good - that makes sense. Once the new posting is live, please invite me so I can spot it right away, and I'll submit the same proposal there.

Bryan Dumont8:12 AM

Perfect. Thanks for your patience
